![MyRouteFinder Screenshot](https://freepngimg.com/download/united_states/76079-google-computer-icons-states-maps-united-location.png)

**MyRouteFinder** is a web application built with React that allows users to find routes between two cities on an interactive map. It uses **Leaflet** for map rendering and **Leaflet Routing Machine** for route calculation. The application also includes a form for users to input their starting point and destination.

---

## Features

- **Interactive Map**: Displays a map using Leaflet and OpenStreetMap tiles.
- **Route Calculation**: Calculates and displays the route between two cities using Leaflet Routing Machine.
- **Form Validation**: Uses `react-hook-form` to validate user inputs.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Custom Markers**: Displays custom markers for the starting point and destination.

---

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Leaflet**: A React wrapper for Leaflet, used for rendering the map.
- **Leaflet Routing Machine**: A plugin for Leaflet to calculate and display routes.
- **react-hook-form**: A library for form validation and management in React.
- **Leaflet CSS**: Styles for Leaflet components.
- **OpenStreetMap**: Provides map tiles for the application.
